- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming data to improve model performance.
- **Visualization**: Tools to visualize data and model performance metrics.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for running the detection system.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ujwalanadella/Cyber-Attack-detection-using-ML.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Cyber-Attack-detection-using-ML
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
   It's recommended to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies. You can do this with the following commands:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing the required libraries, you can start using the project by following these steps:

1. **Run the main script**:
   Execute the following command to start the detection process:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts**:
   The script will guide you through the process, including data loading, model selection, and results visualization.

3. **View results**:
   After the detection process completes, you can view the results, including accuracy metrics and visualizations.

## Data Sources

The project may require datasets for training and testing the machine learning models. Ensure that you have access to relevant datasets, such as:

- [KDD Cup 1999 Data](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/)
- [CICIDS 2017 Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/malmem-2020.html)

Make sure to place the dataset files in the appropriate directory before running the project.
